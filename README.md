## Eclipse Passage Images

### What is it

This repository contains passage project-specific graphics sources.

Here you can find:

- .svg vector image files
- .png raster image files
- .bmp raster image files (primarily, icons)

### Structure

All images are sorted into folders named the same as the bundles, where these resources are located in passage project (E.g. in "org.eclipse.passage.loc.operator" you will find resources related to _org.eclipse.passage.loc.operator_ bundle of passage project). 

In every "bundle folder" you can find few other folders named as extensions of files contained in these folders (E.g. folder name "svg" means that there are some .svg files in it).
